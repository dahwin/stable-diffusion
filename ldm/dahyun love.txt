	Confessing Jules

	Did you think of "turtle sees turtle"?

	Cutie
	Even if you hit a turtle 🐢
	I typed "turtle" 🐢
	Explanation:

	The passage is a reaction to a song or movie called "거북이" (Geobukgi), which means "turtle" in Korean. The speaker is a woman who is in love with a man. She is expressing her feelings for him by comparing him to a turtle.

	In the first two lines, the speaker says that she was reminded of the movie "거북이" when she saw something. She then compares the man she is in love with to Jules, a character in the movie who is also in love with a man.

	In the third line, the speaker asks if the man she is in love with thinks of her as a turtle. This is a reference to the Korean idiom "자라 보고 거북이" (jara bogo geobukgi), which means "to have an affinity for someone or something."

	In the fourth line, the speaker calls the man she is in love with "귀염둥이" (gwiyeomdongi), which means "cutie" or "darling."

	In the fifth line, the speaker says that even if she hits the man she is in love with, she will still love him. This is a reference to the Korean idiom "거북이 쳐도 🐢" (geobukgi cheodo 🐢), which is a play on words that means "even if you hit a turtle."

	In the sixth line, the speaker says that she typed "turtle" in a text message to the man she is in love with. This is a reference to the song "거북이" (Geobukgi), which is about a woman who is in love with a man.
